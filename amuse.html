        <h1>Stuff I like</h1>
        <h3>by Duncan Widhalm</h3>
        <p>The internet is a great place to find interesting and funny websites.</p>
        

        <h2>Dancing Cow </h2>
        <p>This is a silly video of a rotating cow gif to a polish song. While the meme itself is funny. It was interesting to learn that the song is not.</p>

        <h2> The <em>Wayback</em> Machine </h2>
        <p>This website can be very cool to look at. It is an archive of the internet. It can be cool to see what older webpages looked like.</p>

        <h2>2048: A Fun Game</h2>
        <p>2048 was a gam that first made its way to me via an Iphone app. However, there is an online version of the game that can be fun to play when you need to kill time while waiting for a class to start (or end ;)</p>
